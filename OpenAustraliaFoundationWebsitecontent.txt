﻿This is a scratchpad for website content for the OpenAustralia Foundation website

The OpenAustralia Foundation was established in 2XXX to encourage all Australians to participate in the political process by making the workings of government more transparent.  We develop and use technology to make government and public sector information freely and easily available to all.  We do this through our three websites: openaustralia.org, planningalerts.org.au and electionleaflets.org.au. 
As a not-for-profit charity, we rely on the support and donations of the public to continue our work.  To make a tax deductible donation or to volunteer your time and expertise please click here.

OpenAustralia.org
=================

OpenAustralia.org is a website that enables people to keep track of what politicians are doing and saying on our behalf in Parliament.  We believe that politicians work for us and that to ensure that we have a healthy democracy we, the public, need to be able to access and search the official Parliamentary records (Hansard) freely and easily. 

OpenAustralia.org breathes life into the dry text of Hansard, we have made it easily searchable, browseable and accessible as never before.  (click here to see OpenAustralia.org) 

We were also the first organisation (and so far the only) website to publish the Federal Register of Interests online.  We provide public access to these records which list politicians' bank accounts, gifts they are given, their share holdings etc. anything, in fact, that which has the potential to prejudice their decisions in Parliament. 

We're proud that we've affected the functioning of Parliament for good.  As a direct result of our actions Parliament will now be publishing the Register of Interests on its own website. This is fantastic news.

We're confident that this would not have happened so quickly had we not done what we did.

PlanningAlerts.org.au
=====================

You'd probably know if your next-door neighbour was going to knock their house down. But you might live in blissful ignorance that your favorite old cinema or pub five streets away will never reopen because its going be converted into luxury flats, until the bulldozers turned up that is.

PlanningAlerts.org.au is a free service which searches planning authority websites for development applications in your area and then emails you their details.  It could not be simpler, you sign up to the service, specify the location you are interested in and then if any applications are lodged in this area you are sent an email.  You can view the applications on a map or even subscribe to a RSS feed.  We don't have the whole country covered yet, but we're working on it!

ElectionLeaflets.org.au
=======================

We launched our latest project, ElectionLeaflets.org.au for the 2010 Federal Elections.

Election leaflets are one of the main weapons in the fight for votes in Australia. They are targeted, effective and sometimes very bitter. Yet, they are largely ignored by the mainstream media.

With ElectionLeaflets.org.au we asked people, instead of throwing those leaflets away, to scan or photograph them and upload them to the website or send the leaflets to us by post so that we could upload them.

For the first time election leaflets were searchable and available for everyone in Australia to view providing transparency on the tactics that the parties used.  We launched the project just a few weeks before the 2010 election in which time we uploaded over 600 leaflets from all across Australia.

“...www.electionleaflets.org.au... The Wikileaks of #ausvotes pamphlets!” - Annabel Crabb, ABC Online's chief political writer
http://twitter.com/annabelcrabb/status/20031356583

"...thank you for your dedication and work. What your site did was valuable and important." - Gruen Nation, ABC
http://twitter.com/GruenHQ/status/23970420172

"...I think that sort of simple and universally accessible store of what people are doing, what candidates are doing, is probably a game-changer." - David Vaile, executive director of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre at the University of New South Wales, in "Political pamphlets under online microscope", ABC News 21 August 2010

"I'd also recommend everyone to participate in sending material to the following website http://www.electionleaflets.org.au/" - Antony Green, ABC's Election analyst, July 28 2010

"It's sites like this one that signify just how important new media has become in 2010." - James Massola, the Australian July 31 2010

“ElectionLeaflets.org.au was a triumph for lovers of political transparency, a grassroots online effort to curate election spin and make politicians accountable. It was useful not only as a 2010 election guide, but as a historical snapshot of the poll. A simple, brilliant idea, which played to the Internet's strengths. I hope it becomes a staple of every Australian campaign.” -  Jon Casimir, Producer Gruen Nation

PlanningAlerts.org.au
---------------------
"Great idea for a service! Well done." - Chris Jennings

"I just wanted to say I reckon this is a great service & fantastic app. Great work." - Rusty Graham, National Creative Writer, dmg radio australia

"Thanks all - brilliant service." - Pru Davison

"Councils spend a lot of time putting ads in the paper, signs on sites and writing to people but it is not always easy to identify the community of interest for a particular development proposal or approval. I see Planning Alerts as a supplement to the statutory notification we undertake and provides us with greater reach as a result." - John Carmichael, Director Environment & Planning, Mosman Council

"OpenAustralia's work is at the cutting edge of Open Government in practice both here in Australia and around the world. Through their services, they're bringing the government closer to the people." - Reem Abdelaty, Program Director, Local-e, Local Government and Shires Associations of New South Wales

OpenAustralia.org
-----------------
"Your website is nothing short of brilliant. As a father of a severely, 42 year old, disabled daughter I can ascertain if politicians are representing these unfortunate members of the community as they assure us they are. When they make assuring statements out in the community we can now monitor their actions, conviction and utterances in Parliament. Sincere thanks" - Brian O'Hart

"Love your work. You have an amazing website." - Craig Reucassel, The Chaser

"So much of information about politicians can only be found on OpenAustralia. It is an essential part of our now unstable democracy." - Craig Reucassel, The Chaser

"Whenever I need to steal great research and claim it as my own I use OpenAustralia. The starting place for anyone wanting to hold our politicians accountable." - Craig Reucassel, The Chaser

"The only place we could find easy access to our politician's Registers of Interest was on OpenAustralia. It's almost as if the politicians wanted to make it hard for us to find it." - Craig Reucassel, The Chaser

"I’m aware of OpenAustralia and the very good work that has been done in bringing TheyWorkForYou.com to an Australian context. Some of my staff now use OpenAustralia regularly as an alternative to Hansard!" - Lindsay Tanner, former Minister for Finance and Deregulation

"I can't express how much I wish OpenAustralia well (and how much I wish it was my idea). Well done." - Simon Elvery

An introductory complimentary statement.... so its just as well he is quite simply the powerhouse behind the OpenAustralia Foundation. The majority of code generated for PlanningAlerts and OpenAustralia was contributed by Matthew. He's also the public face of the OpenAustralia Foundation, ... speaking engagements and presentations at government & technical.... (full sentence please). Full time.

Kat is the Foundation's connector and in her bounding, unstoppable, thoroughly optimistic style has subversive ideas and makes connections between people like noone else can.

Outside of the foundation, 
 
Bug people write stuff. Optimism. Connection with local community, volunteer gardener. Works on OAF about half the time. Submitted paper with CPD for gov 2.0 taskforce submission ... LGSA writing? Opens conversations with gov.
 
How we work
===========
 
The Open part of OpenAustralia Foundation is pretty important to everything we do, and how we do it. [mindmap]
 
We work openly and collaboratively with people who volunteer, local state and federal government workers, and people in non profit organisations as well as for profit companies. We know the best solutions can come from anywhere.
 
OpenSource Community
 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">OpenSource</a> in principle and practice are a great inspiration for the way we work. We'd like to see the opening up and sharing the most basic tools of our societies, including the way we make decisions. Our governance, our legislation, our community services public and private institutions can all benefit from a good airing. There are new challenges for everyone in trusting a wider group of people to contribute to the things that affect our daily lives, and open source communities have experienced many of the challenges first hand.
 
Hackfests bring that community together to focus on solving a problem and creating opportunities for people to come together who continue to work together remotely.
 
User Centered Design Approach
 
Well I started to write something here, and I think someone else who has a deeper understanding of the subject should write it.

About
=====

The OpenAustralia Foundation is a pioneering charity whose vision is transform democracy in Australia.  Our mission is to give all Australians the tools they need to affect the change they want.  We do this by creating technologies that encourage and enable people to participate directly in the political process on a local, community and national level. 

We currently do this through our three websites OpenAustralia.org, Planningalerts.com.au and electionleaflets.org.au.  These websites aim at finding better ways of making government, the public sector and political information freely and easily available for the benefit of all Australians.   This transparency aims to encourage and inform people about how they can make a difference.   
The OpenAustralia Foundation is a strictly non-partisan organization.  We are not the government, nor are we affiliated with any political party.  We are simply passionate about making our democracy work.  We believe that we can help to reinvigorate Australia's civic culture by using powerful and exciting new technologies to inform and empower people, to address the growing disconnect between Government and the people who elect it.   

History

In 2004 Matthew Landauer and Katherine Szuminska attended the launch of TheyWorkForYou.com, a British website that encouraged people to find out what work their political representatives actually did for them.  This speech and the success of the website inspired Matthew and Kat explore the possibilities of setting up a similar site here in Australia.

Three years later Matthew was given the opportunity by his then employer Rising Sun Pictures to take a week of paid charity leave.  He used this time to develop the first, very rough, prototype of OpenAustralia.org.  Since that time, with the help of volunteers and the odd charitable donation the OpenAustralia Foundation has achieved the following milestones.  

<Timeline of different things we have done so far - major milestones>

* Initial prototype of OpenAustralia.org

Or if you do have specialist skills we'd welcome your efforts in the following areas:
